# Elastic CI Stack for AWS

The [Elastic CI Stack for AWS](https://github.com/buildkite/elastic-ci-stack-for-aws) gives you a private, autoscaling Buildkite Agent cluster in your own AWS account. This guide will lead you through getting started with the stack :cloudformation::tada:

## Creating an AWS EC2 Key Pair

The first thing you’ll need is an [EC2 Key Pair](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) to allow you to SSH into EC2 instances created by the Elastic CI stack. If you already have a Key Pair that you'd like to use, you can head straight to [Launching the Stack](#launching-the-stack).

To create an EC2 Key Pair, sign into the AWS Console, and go to the EC2 service:

Then go to _“Key Pairs”_ under _“Network & Security”_:

<%= image "ec2-key-pair.png", size: "#{380/2}x#{290/2}", alt: 'AWS EC2 Key Pair' %>

Click the _“Create Key Pair”_ button in the top left hand corner and give it a name.

## Launching the Stack

Go to the _“Agents”_ page on Buildkite and select the _“AWS”_ tab:

<%= image "agents-tab.png", size: '647x166', alt: 'Buildkite AWS Agents' %>

Click _“Launch Stack”_ :red_button:

<%= image "agents-tab-launch.png", size: "#{478/2}x#{324/2}", alt: 'Launch Buildkite Elastic CI Stack' %>

<%= image "aws-select-template.png", size: '627x456', alt: 'AWS Select Template Screen' %>

After clicking _“Next”_ you’ll configure the stack using the details from Buildkite:

<%= image "aws-parameters.png", size: '561x311', alt: 'AWS Parameters' %>

By default the stack uses a job queue of `default` but you can specify any other queue name you’d like. See the [Buildkite Agent Job Queue docs](/docs/agent/v3/queues) for more info.

Once you're ready, click the _“I acknowledge that this template might cause AWS CloudFormation to create IAM resources.”_ checkbox then click _“Create”_:

<%= image "aws-create-stack.png", size: "#{1250/2}x#{541/2}", alt: 'AWS Create Stack Button' %>

After creating the stack, you'll be taken to the CloudFormation console. Click the _“Refresh”_ button in the top right hand corner of the screen until you see the stack being created.

You've now got a working Elastic CI Stack ready to run builds! :tada:

## Running your first build

We’ve created a sample [bash-parallel-example sample pipeline](https://github.com/buildkite/bash-parallel-example) for you to test with your new autoscaling stack. Click the _“Add to Buildkite”_ button below (or on the [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/buildkite/bash-parallel-example)):

Your pipeline is now ready for its first build. Click "New Build" in the top right and choose a build message (perhaps a little party `\:parrot\:`?):

<%= image "buildkite-new-build.png", size: "#{970/2}x#{871/2}", alt: 'Triggering Buildkite Build' %>

Once your build is created head back to [AWS EC2 Autoscaling console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home) to monitor the Elastic CI stack creating new EC2 instances:

<%= image "ec2-service.png", size: "#{425/2}x#{258/2}", alt: 'AWS EC2' %>

<%= image "ec2-asg.png", size: "#{390/2}x#{170/2}", alt: 'AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Group Menu' %>

Select the _“buildkite-AgentAutoScaleGroup-xxx”_ group and then the the _“Instances”_ tab. You'll see instances starting up to run your new build and after a few minutes they'll transition from `Pending` to `InService`:

<%= image "buildkite-demo-instances.png", width: 1876/2, height: 1154/2, alt: 'AWS Auto Scaling Group Launching' %>

Once the instances are ready you'll see them appear on your Buildkite Agents page:

<%= image "buildkite-connected-agents.png", size: "#{925/2}x#{929/2}", alt: 'Buildkite Connected Agents' %>

And then your build will start running on your new agents:

Congratulations on running your first Elastic CI Stack build on Buildkite! :clap::tada:
