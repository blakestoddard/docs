# Manual SSO Setup with GraphQL

- can self-serve your SSO setup with Buildkite using GraphQL
- follow the steps below to enable sso for your org
- set up Buildkite in your identity provider, guides available for x x and x

## How to enable SSO for your Org

- you need the service URL from Buildkite before you can finish setting up things in your identity provider

- two ways to do this process: 
    - set up a blank SSO provider in Buildkite, do the set up in your SSO provider, come back and update your blank Buildkite SSO to contain the details of your provider
    - set up your identity provider, set up your SSO in Buildkite with the details, go back to your identity provider and add the service url 

how to set things up in Buildkite
- run the graphql operations in order

### Get your internal Organization ID

- to set up your organisation for SSO, you need your internal Buildkite id
- use the get method with your org slug to retrieve your org id
- this id will be required in all other sso methods

### Create your SSO provider

- use the create method, this can be blank or can contain your provider information
- can choose from three different provider types: SAML, GOOGLE_SSO, and GITHUB_SSO
- if you choose to add provider information when you create your provider, there are three data entry options: static data entry, xml blob, and xml url

- if you haven't set up your identity provider with buildkite, do that before continuing
- test the login flow

### Enable the provider for your organisation

- after testing that the new authorisation url works and can log in a user with the correct email domain, you can enable the sso provider for your buildkite organisation
-  use the enable method with your organisation id
-  check that it's enabled with the get method

### Update your provider data

- use this if you've made a blank sso provider and need to add your provider information to it
- also can be used to update your provider data if it changes

- can't do an update while the provider is enabled, need to disable it, make your changes, then re-test and re-enable it once it's all working

## Disable a provider

- use the disable method

## Delete a provider

- use the delete method
- all users will go back to logging in with their buildkite username and password

## Other information

- can have as many different providers enabled at the same time as you need, they will all be displayed to users before they go through the authorisation flow
- can add a note to each provider login option in this list, to provide information to your users about each one 
- can set session duration
