# Getting Started

This guide will help you setup your first Buildkite pipeline. If you don’t have a Buildkite account you’ll first need to [sign up](<%= url_helpers.signup_path %>). This guide uses GitHub but Buildkite can work with any version control system.

## Start your first agent

Once you’ve logged in, follow the instructions on the Agents page to install and start an agent. You can do this on your local development machine, an existing CI machine, or a new server.

## Add the sample pipeline

We’ve created a simple [bash-example test repository](https://github.com/buildkite/bash-example) to use as your first pipeline. Click the “Add to Buildkite” button below to open a new pipeline page for the example pipeline:

## Create your first build

Now that you’ve started an agent and created a pipeline you’re ready to run your first build. Click the *New Build* button in the top right corner:

Type in a build message (being sure to add some emojis) and click *Create Build*:

<%= image "trigger-build.png", size: "514x450", alt: "New build dialog" %>

You should now see the build start to run, and once it’s finished it should turn green!

Congratulations, you’ve just run your first Buildkite build! :tada:

## Invite your team to the organization

To invite your team so they can see your build, go to your organization’s *Settings*, and under *Members* you’ll be able to paste in their email addresses.

## Using a private repository

When you create a new pipeline with a private repository URL you’ll be shown instructions for configuring your SCM’s webhooks (in GitHub, BitBucket, etc). Once you’ve followed those instructions make sure your [agent’s SSH keys](/docs/agent/v3/ssh-keys) are configured, and you’ll be good to run a build of your private pipeline.

For more advanced pipelines it can be a good idea to use your development machine as the agent for your first few builds. That way all the dependencies are ready and you’ll sooner be able to share a link to a green build with the rest of your team.
